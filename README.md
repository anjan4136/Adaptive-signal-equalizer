# Adaptive-signal-equalizer
1) Designing an equalizer(removing the noise from a signal), which is adaptive i.e updating weights by lms learning alogorithm.
2) I have done it with the help of inbuilt functional blocks in matlab. 
3) You will need a license to use those blocks in matlab. or you can develop codes by yourselves.
